        <p>
          Our parent company, Dem Fırat Karven Tekstil, was established in 1991
          in Istanbul by Cuma Ozturk. Cuma was the eldest child in a family with
          21 kids. He grew up near the Iranian border on the rural side of
          Turkey. Because of the lack of resources during his childhood, he
          dropped out of school at the age of nine and started working at local
          shops.

            <p>
              {`Cuma's parents' negligence and being the eldest among his siblings
              left him with an immense responsibility to work hard and provide
              for his family. So to make money fast, he started crossing the
              Iranian border as a kid to buy goods at a cheaper rate, then
              brought and traded them in Turkey.`}

              Yet, after getting caught numerously and punished by the
              authorities, he knew he needed to find a long-term, less risky
              alternative. So at 13, he moved to the West of Turkey all by
              himself for better job opportunities. After a decade of hard,
              laborious work at construction sites, restaurants, and retail
              shops on the West side of the country, in 1991, at the age of 23,
              he opened his first textile shop in Laleli, Istanbul, with a
              business partner. However, in 1997, when his first child was born
              (that's me!), the partners had disagreements, leading them to
              separate ways.

              Although his former partners tried to discourage and force him out
              of business, this only powered him to open his own textile store.
              His genuine attitude and fine quality of his products made his
              shop recognized. With the growing demand, he started bringing his
              siblings left on the East side of the country and employing them
